# Validate Secure Password
Validate whether the user's password is secure according to pre-defined criteria.

## Business Rules:

  • check that the password has at least 8 characters;  
  • check whether the password contains at least one capital letter;  
  • check whether the password contains at least one lowercase letter;  
  • check whether the password contains at least one numeric digit;  
  • check if the password contains at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%);
